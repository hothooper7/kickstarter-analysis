# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Use the Kickstarter dataset to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
Demonstrate to Louise how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
The biggest challenge that I encountered was working with the Date Created Conversion column.  I did not have an issue with the formula but excel was having trouble copying the formula to all of the cells within the column.  This led to multiple errors when creating my pivot tables based on launch date.  After troubleshooting with my advisors, it was discovered that excel was not duplicating my formula in all of the cells within the column.  This was a good lesson to learn, as I now know not to rely exclusively on the copy method, and to double check my work.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There were many more successful campaigns in the early spring months.  This could be due to the fact that people have more disposable income as a result of tax returns.  Also, holiday spending in the winter months could lead to tighter budgets and as a result, less disposable income to spend on funding the campaign.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Most of the data for outcomes based on goals is in the $0 - $15,000 range.  It seems to be very clear that when goals more modest (like in the $0 - $5000 range), they have a much higher chance for success.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Trying to analyze outcomes based on launch date was very difficult for me.  Creating the analysis was no problem but trying to glean what the results meant was a challenge.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There are many more fundraising campaigns in the spring and summer months (April-July).
Theater fundraising campaigns rarely get canceled.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The more modest the budget for theater fundraising, the more likely it is that the goals will be met.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset does not account for types of investors, or how active the campaign was in soliciting donations.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would like to see a goal vs. month line graph to see if there was any correlation to budgets vs. time of year.  Perhaps bigger productions happen during a certain time of the year and this could help me draw more meaningful conclusions.
